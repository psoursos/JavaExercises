7. Program should ask your weight and planet. Compute your weight on the planet based on the table below:
#    Planet    Relative gravity
1    Venus        0.78
2    Mars        0.39
3    Jupiter    2.65
4    Saturn    1.17
5    Uranus    1.05
6    Neptune    1.23
So, for example, if your weight is 80 kg on earth, then you would weigh just over 31 kg on Mars, since Mars' gravity is 0.39 times earth's gravity. (80 * 0.39 is 31.20)


8. Create a method that accepts an integer and returns the day of the week (Advanced).


9. Use ternary to return a message child or adult. Older than 18 is adult.
